A fast and memory-efficient Python feature generating framework for machine learning.

Deprecation Warning
------------
This package is deprecated. Please use https://github.com/ianlini/dagian instead.

Introduction
------------
This package is currently not stable. This README is for version ``1.0.0a7``, but the current version in the master branch is very different from ``1.0.0a7``. If you want to use the latest version, please look at the tested examples.

Installation
------------
.. code:: bash

   pip install feagen==1.0.0a7
   
Getting start
-------------
Getting start from the simple `lifetime prediction example </examples/lifetime_prediction/>`_ is an easy way.
You can first look at the raw data `lifetime.csv </examples/lifetime_prediction/lifetime.csv>`_ and then you may better understand what we are doing to the data.

Creating the feature generator
******************************
The most important part in Feagen is the feature generator class.
You first need to define a class like in `lifetime_feature_generator.py </examples/lifetime_prediction/lifetime_feature_generator.py>`_ to tell Feagen how to deal with the data.
(TODO: more details)

Creating the config files
*************************
There is a command line tool ``feagen-init`` that can help create the initial config files: the global config ``.feagenrc/config.yml`` and the bundle config ``.feagenrc/bundle_config.yml``.
You can look at the comments that are automatically generated in those files or in `examples/lifetime_prediction/.feagenrc </examples/lifetime_prediction/.feagenrc>`_ to understand how to change them.
(TODO: more details)

Drawing the directed acyclic graph (DAG)
****************************************
There is one way for you to check if the dependency is correct.
You can use the command line tool ``feagen-draw-dag`` to draw the DAG image:

   usage: feagen-draw-dag [-h] [-g GLOBAL_CONFIG] [-d DAG_OUTPUT_PATH]

   Generate DAG.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -g GLOBAL_CONFIG, --global-config GLOBAL_CONFIG
                           the path of the path configuration YAML file (default:
                           .feagenrc/config.yml)
     -d DAG_OUTPUT_PATH, --dag-output-path DAG_OUTPUT_PATH
                           output image path (default: dag.png)

You can specify the paths of the global config and the output image using ``-g`` and ``-d`` respectively.
Running ``feagen-draw-dag -d fig/dag.png`` in `examples/lifetime_prediction/ </examples/lifetime_prediction/>`_ will give you `examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/dag.png </examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/dag.png>`_:

.. image:: /examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/dag.png

(Note that the order may not be the same)

Generating features
*******************
After the generator class and the config are defined, we can now generate the features.
A command line tool ``feagen`` can be used now:

   usage: feagen [-h] [-g GLOBAL_CONFIG] [-b BUNDLE_CONFIG] [-d DAG_OUTPUT_PATH]
                 [--no-bundle]

   Generate global data and data bundle.

   optional arguments:
     -h, --help            show this help message and exit
     -g GLOBAL_CONFIG, --global-config GLOBAL_CONFIG
                           the path of the path configuration YAML file (default:
                           .feagenrc/config.yml)
     -b BUNDLE_CONFIG, --bundle-config BUNDLE_CONFIG
                           the path of the bundle configuration YAML file
                           (default: .feagenrc/bundle_config.yml)
     -d DAG_OUTPUT_PATH, --dag-output-path DAG_OUTPUT_PATH
                           draw the involved subDAG to the provided path
                           (default: None)
     --no-bundle           not generate the data bundle

You can specify the paths of the global config, the bundle config, and the involved subDAG image using ``-g``, ``-b`` and ``-d`` respectively.

The program will first find the nodes in the DAG that are involved and build a subDAG for this task, and check whether the data has been generated in the global data.
The resulting DAG after these checks will be output if you specify ``-d``.
For example, in `examples/lifetime_prediction/`_, if you run ``feagen`` first and then add a new feature ``height_divided_by_weight``, and run ``feagen -d fig/involved_dag.png``, you will get an image `examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/involved_dag.png </examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/involved_dag.png>`_:

.. image:: /examples/lifetime_prediction/fig/involved_dag.png

(Note that the order may not be the same)

After the subDAG is generated, the program will start running the methods you implemented in the generator class in an appropriate order, and then output to the global data.
The global data will not be removed and can be reused.
If you want to generate another bundle, the data that has been generated will not be generated again.
This saves much time!

Finally, the data bundle is generated according to the ``structure`` specified in the bundle config.
You can use `hdfview <https://support.hdfgroup.org/products/java/hdfview/>`_ to check the resulting global data and data bundle.
It may help you understand what the output is.
You can also use the argument ``--no-bundle`` if you don't want to generate the data bundle (only the global data will be generated).

Now, you can use the data bundle to do machine learning!
